**###INSTALLATION**
Step-by-step guide to installing Engima-Sphere on GitHub:

    Clone the Repository:

    Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the Engima-Sphere repository.

    

    git clone https://github.com/AbdiDesalegn/engima-sphere.git
    cd engima-sphere

Install Dependencies:

First, navigate to the client directory and install frontend dependencies.



cd client
npm install

Next, navigate to the server directory and install backend dependencies.



cd ../server
npm install

Set Up Environment Variables:

In the server directory, create a .env file and set the required environment variables.



MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key

Replace your-mongodb-uri with your MongoDB connection URI, and your-secret-key with a secure secret key for JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Start the Application:

Return to the root directory of the project and start both the frontend and backend servers.



cd ..
npm start

Access the Application:

Once both servers are running, you can access the Engima-Sphere application in your web browser. Open your browser and enter the following URL:



    http://localhost:3000

    You should see the Engima-Sphere landing page and be able to explore its various features.

Usage:

The example code provided earlier demonstrated how to use a package called amazing-package. However, since Engima-Sphere is a full-fledged social platform and not just a package, the usage is different.

To use Engima-Sphere, you can interact with the frontend user interface to create posts, customize your profile, interact with other users' posts, send messages, and explore trending content. The usage of Engima-Sphere is primarily through its intuitive and user-friendly web interface.
